6. **06-concurrency**: Goroutines, channels, and concurrent programming

## How to Use

Each exercise contains:

- A README.md with the problem description
- A main Go file with the function to implement
- A test file with test cases

To run the tests:

```bash
cd <exercise-directory>
go test -v
```
